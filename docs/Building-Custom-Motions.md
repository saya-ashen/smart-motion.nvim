# Building Custom Motions

> **Want to tweak an existing motion instead of building from scratch?** Start with the [Recipes](Recipes.md) guide for practical examples like making `f` single-char, words bidirectional, or search line-constrained.

This is where SmartMotion becomes yours.

Every built-in motion uses the same system you're about to learn. There's no magic, no internal APIs. Just a pipeline you can configure however you want.

---

## Your First Custom Motion

Let's create a motion that jumps to words after the cursor and centers the screen:

```lua
require("smart-motion").register_motion("gw", {
  collector = "lines",
  extractor = "words",
  filter = "filter_words_after_cursor",
  visualizer = "hint_start",
  action = "jump_centered",
  map = true,
  modes = { "n", "v" },
})
```

That's it. Press `gw`, labels appear on words ahead, press a label, cursor jumps there and screen centers.

Let's break it down:

| Field | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `collector` | Where to look: `"lines"` means all buffer lines |
| `extractor` | What to find: `"words"` finds word boundaries |
| `filter` | Which to show: `"filter_words_after_cursor"` keeps only words ahead |
| `visualizer` | How to display: `"hint_start"` puts labels at word start |
| `action` | What to do: `"jump_centered"` moves cursor and centers screen |
| `map` | Whether to create a keymap |
| `modes` | Which vim modes this works in |

---

## The Pipeline

Every motion flows through this pipeline:

```
Collector → Extractor → Modifier → Filter → Visualizer → Selection → Action
```

Each stage is optional (except collector, extractor, visualizer, action). Each stage is a module you can swap.

### Collectors

**Where to look for targets.**

| Collector | What it collects |
|-----------|------------------|
| `lines` | All lines in the buffer |
| `treesitter` | Treesitter syntax nodes |
| `diagnostics` | LSP diagnostics |
| `git_hunks` | Git changed regions |
| `quickfix` | Quickfix/location list entries |
| `marks` | Vim marks |
| `history` | SmartMotion jump history |

### Extractors

**What to find within collected data.**

| Extractor | What it extracts |
|-----------|------------------|
| `words` | Word boundaries via regex |
| `lines` | Entire lines as targets |
| `text_search_1_char` | Single character matches |
| `text_search_2_char` | Two character matches (for `f`/`F`) |
| `text_search_2_char_until` | Two char, exclude target (for `t`/`T`) |
| `live_search` | Incremental search as you type |
| `fuzzy_search` | Fuzzy matching |
| `pass_through` | Use collector output directly |

### Filters

**Which targets to keep.**

| Filter | What it keeps |
|--------|---------------|
| `default` | Everything (no filtering) |
| `filter_visible` | Only visible in viewport |
| `filter_words_after_cursor` | Words after cursor |
| `filter_words_before_cursor` | Words before cursor |
| `filter_words_around_cursor` | Words in both directions |
| `filter_lines_after_cursor` | Lines after cursor |
| `filter_lines_before_cursor` | Lines before cursor |
| `filter_cursor_line_only` | Only on cursor line |
| `first_target` | Only the first target |

### Visualizers

**How to display targets.**

| Visualizer | How it displays |
|------------|-----------------|
| `hint_start` | Label at target start |
| `hint_end` | Label at target end |

### Actions

**What to do when user selects.**

| Action | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `jump` | Move cursor to target |
| `jump_centered` | Move cursor and center screen |
| `delete` | Delete target text (no cursor movement) |
| `delete_jump` | Jump to target, then delete |
| `delete_line` | Jump to target, delete entire line |
| `yank` | Yank target text (no cursor movement) |
| `yank_jump` | Jump to target, then yank |
| `yank_line` | Jump to target, yank entire line |
| `change` | Delete target and enter insert mode |
| `change_jump` | Jump to target, delete, enter insert |
| `change_line` | Jump to target, change entire line |
| `paste` | Paste at target (no cursor movement) |
| `paste_jump` | Jump to target, then paste |
| `paste_line` | Jump to target, paste entire line |
| `remote_delete` | Delete target, restore cursor (stays in place) |
| `remote_delete_line` | Delete line, restore cursor |
| `remote_yank` | Yank target, restore cursor |
| `remote_yank_line` | Yank line, restore cursor |
| `center` | Center screen on cursor |
| `restore` | Restore cursor to original position |

**Action naming pattern:**
- `delete`/`yank`/`change`/`paste`: operate on target text without moving cursor
- `*_jump`: jump to target first, then operate (used by composable operators like `dw`)
- `remote_*`: jump, operate, restore cursor (cursor stays in place, for `rdw`/`ryw`)
- `*_line`: line-wise variants (used by double-tap: `dd`, `yy`, `cc`)

---

## Combining Actions

Want a motion that does multiple things? Use `merge`:

```lua
local merge = require("smart-motion.core.utils").action_utils.merge

require("smart-motion").register_motion("gy", {
  collector = "lines",
  extractor = "words",
  filter = "filter_words_after_cursor",
  visualizer = "hint_start",
  action = merge({ "jump", "yank" }),  -- jump THEN yank
  map = true,
  modes = { "n" },
})
```

Now `gy` jumps to a word and yanks it.

More examples:

```lua
-- Jump, delete, and center
action = merge({ "jump", "delete", "center" })

-- Yank without moving (remote yank)
action = merge({ "yank", "restore" })
```

---

## Example: Jump to Functions

```lua
require("smart-motion").register_motion("<leader>f", {
  collector = "treesitter",
  extractor = "pass_through",
  filter = "filter_visible",
  visualizer = "hint_start",
  action = "jump_centered",
  map = true,
  modes = { "n" },
  metadata = {
    motion_state = {
      ts_node_types = {
        "function_declaration",
        "function_definition",
        "arrow_function",
        "method_definition",
        "function_item",
      },
    },
  },
})
```

The `treesitter` collector uses `ts_node_types` to find matching syntax nodes. Since treesitter already yields full targets, we use `pass_through` extractor.

---

## Example: Jump to Errors Only

```lua
require("smart-motion").register_motion("<leader>e", {
  collector = "diagnostics",
  extractor = "pass_through",
  filter = "filter_visible",
  visualizer = "hint_start",
  action = "jump_centered",
  map = true,
  modes = { "n" },
  metadata = {
    motion_state = {
      diagnostic_severity = vim.diagnostic.severity.ERROR,
    },
  },
})
```

The `diagnostics` collector respects `diagnostic_severity` to filter by severity level.

---

## Example: Live Search

```lua
require("smart-motion").register_motion("<leader>s", {
  collector = "lines",
  extractor = "live_search",
  filter = "filter_visible",
  visualizer = "hint_start",
  action = "jump_centered",
  map = true,
  modes = { "n" },
  metadata = {
    motion_state = {
      multi_window = true,  -- search across all visible windows
    },
  },
})
```

The `live_search` extractor handles user input automatically. Labels update as you type.

---

## Example: 2-Char Find

```lua
require("smart-motion").register_motion("<leader>f", {
  collector = "lines",
  extractor = "text_search_2_char",
  filter = "filter_words_after_cursor",
  visualizer = "hint_start",
  action = "jump",
  map = true,
  modes = { "n", "o" },
})
```

The `text_search_2_char` extractor prompts for 2 characters before showing labels.

---

## Example: Function Name Text Object

This is how the built-in `fn` text object works. It's a good template for building custom treesitter-based text objects:

```lua
require("smart-motion").register_motion("fn", {
  collector = "treesitter",
  extractor = "pass_through",
  modifier = "weight_distance",
  filter = "filter_visible",
  visualizer = "hint_start",
  action = "textobject_select",
  composable = true,
  map = true,
  modes = { "o" },
  metadata = {
    motion_state = {
      ts_node_types = {
        "function_declaration",
        "function_definition",
        "method_definition",
      },
      ts_child_field = "name",  -- only the "name" field of the function
      is_textobject = true,
    },
  },
})
```

The `ts_child_field` option makes the collector yield only the specified named field (like `name`) from matching nodes. The `textobject_select` action sets a charwise visual selection, which the pending operator then applies to. Since `fn` is `composable = true`, it works with the multi-char infer system: `dfn` typed quickly resolves as function name, `df` + pause falls through to find-char.

---

## Example: Multi-Window Search

```lua
require("smart-motion").register_motion("<leader>/", {
  collector = "lines",
  extractor = "live_search",
  filter = "filter_visible",
  visualizer = "hint_start",
  action = "jump_centered",
  map = true,
  modes = { "n" },
  metadata = {
    motion_state = {
      multi_window = true,
    },
  },
})
```

Setting `multi_window = true` makes the collector run across all visible windows.

---

## Treesitter Collector Modes

The `treesitter` collector supports four modes depending on which fields you set:

### 1. Raw Query (`ts_query`)

Full treesitter query power:

```lua
metadata = {
  motion_state = {
    ts_query = "(function_declaration) @func",
  },
}
```

### 2. Node Type Matching (`ts_node_types`)

Jump to nodes of specific types:

```lua
metadata = {
  motion_state = {
    ts_node_types = { "function_declaration", "class_definition" },
  },
}
```

### 3. Child Field (`ts_node_types` + `ts_child_field`)

Jump to a specific named field of matched nodes:

```lua
metadata = {
  motion_state = {
    ts_node_types = { "function_declaration" },
    ts_child_field = "name",  -- jump to function names
  },
}
```

### 4. Yield Children (`ts_node_types` + `ts_yield_children`)

Jump to individual children of container nodes (like arguments):

```lua
metadata = {
  motion_state = {
    ts_node_types = { "arguments", "parameters" },
    ts_yield_children = true,
    ts_around_separator = true,  -- include commas in range
  },
}
```

---

## Adding motion_state

The `metadata.motion_state` field lets you set initial state for your motion:

```lua
metadata = {
  motion_state = {
    direction = "after",        -- or "before"
    multi_window = true,        -- enable multi-window
    ts_node_types = { ... },    -- for treesitter
    diagnostic_severity = ...,  -- for diagnostics
    sort_by = "sort_weight",    -- sort targets by metadata
    sort_descending = false,    -- sort direction
  },
},
```

See **[API Reference](API-Reference.md)** for all motion_state fields.

---

## Per-Mode motion_state Overrides

Sometimes you want a motion to behave differently depending on which vim mode it was triggered from. The classic example is `w`: in normal and visual mode it should jump to the word start, but in operator-pending mode `dw` should stop *before* the word (exclusive), matching native vim.

Use string keys in the `modes` table to declare per-mode `motion_state` overrides:

```lua
require("smart-motion").register_motion("w", {
  composable = true,
  collector = "lines",
  extractor = "words",
  filter = "filter_words_after_cursor",
  visualizer = "hint_start",
  action = "jump_centered",
  map = true,
  -- "n" and "v" are registered normally
  -- in operator-pending mode, exclude_target = true is applied automatically
  modes = { "n", "v", o = { exclude_target = true } },
})
```

Array entries are plain mode strings. String-keyed entries (like `o = { ... }`) do two things:

1. Register the keymap for that mode (same as adding `"o"` to the array)
2. Merge the given fields into `motion_state` when that mode is active

The override is applied **after** the standard `metadata.motion_state` merge, so it always wins.

**The mode key is matched to the normalized vim mode character:**

| Key in `modes` | Matches |
|---------------|---------|
| `"n"` | Normal mode |
| `"v"` | Visual mode |
| `"o"` | Operator-pending (`vim.fn.mode(true)` returns `"no"`, normalized to `"o"`) |
| `"i"` | Insert mode |

You can override any `motion_state` field this way, not just `exclude_target`:

```lua
-- disable multi-window in op-pending (operators expect same-buffer motion)
modes = { "n", "v", o = { multi_window = false } }

-- use a different word pattern in visual mode
modes = { "n", v = { word_pattern = "\\k\\+" } }
```

## Registering in Your Config

With lazy.nvim:

```lua
{
  "FluxxField/smart-motion.nvim",
  config = function()
    local sm = require("smart-motion")

    sm.setup({
      presets = { ... },
    })

    -- Register custom motions after setup
    sm.register_motion("gw", {
      collector = "lines",
      extractor = "words",
      filter = "filter_words_after_cursor",
      visualizer = "hint_start",
      action = "jump_centered",
      map = true,
      modes = { "n", "v" },
    })
  end,
}
```

---

## Creating Custom Modules

Want to go deeper? You can create your own collectors, extractors, filters, visualizers, and actions.

### Custom Filter

```lua
local M = {}

function M.run(targets, ctx, cfg, motion_state)
  -- Keep only targets containing "TODO"
  return vim.tbl_filter(function(target)
    return target.text:match("TODO")
  end, targets)
end

return M
```

Register it:

```lua
require("smart-motion.core.registries"):get().filters.register("todo_only", M)
```

Use it:

```lua
filter = "todo_only"
```

### Custom Action

```lua
local M = {}

function M.run(ctx, cfg, motion_state)
  local target = motion_state.selected_jump_target
  if not target then return end

  -- Do something with the target
  vim.notify("Selected: " .. target.text)
end

return M
```

Register it:

```lua
require("smart-motion.core.registries"):get().actions.register("notify_target", M)
```

Use it:

```lua
action = "notify_target"
```

---

## Infer Mode (Advanced)

The `infer` flag enables composable operators. Press an operator key, then a motion key. SmartMotion automatically looks up the motion, inherits its entire pipeline, and runs it with the operator's action.

### How It Works

```lua
require("smart-motion").register_motion("d", {
  infer = true,
  collector = "lines",           -- default pipeline (overridden by target motion)
  filter = "filter_visible",     -- default filter (overridden by target motion)
  visualizer = "hint_start",     -- default visualizer (overridden by target motion)
  map = true,
  modes = { "n" },
  metadata = {
    motion_state = {
      allow_quick_action = true,  -- enable repeat-key quick action (dww)
    },
  },
})
```

When `infer = true`:
1. First keypress (`d`) triggers the operator
2. Second keypress (`w`) is read via `getchar()`
3. The infer system looks up a **composable motion** registered with that key
4. If found, the operator's pipeline is overridden with the motion's extractor, filter, visualizer, collector, and metadata
5. The pipeline runs, labels appear, user picks a target
6. The action executes. For `d`/`y`/`c`/`p`, this is **jump to target + action** (e.g., `delete_jump`)

If the motion key doesn't match any composable motion, it falls through to native vim (`d$`, `d0`, `dG` all work as expected).

### Motion-Based Inference

The key to the infer system is the `composable` flag on motions. Any motion can opt in:

```lua
require("smart-motion").register_motion("w", {
  composable = true,    -- ← this makes it work with d, y, c, p
  collector = "lines",
  extractor = "words",
  filter = "filter_words_after_cursor",
  visualizer = "hint_start",
  action = "jump_centered",
  map = true,
  modes = { "n", "v", "o" },
})
```

Now `dw`, `yw`, `cw`, `pw` all work, each inheriting `words` extractor + `filter_words_after_cursor` + `hint_start` visualizer from the `w` motion. The 11 built-in composable motions (`w`, `b`, `e`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `S`, `f`, `F`, `t`, `T`) × 5 operators = **55+ compositions** from zero explicit mappings.

### Action Key Decoupling

Operators use `action_key` (not `trigger_key`) for registry lookups, enabling custom trigger keys:

```lua
require("smart-motion").register_motion("d", {
  infer = true,
  trigger_key = "<leader>d",  -- custom keybinding
  -- action_key defaults to "d" (the registration name)
  -- ...
})
```

Now `<leader>d` + `w` works identically to `d` + `w`. The `action_key` is what the infer system uses to find the right action in the registry (`delete_jump` for `"d"`, `yank_jump` for `"y"`, etc.) and to detect double-tap (`<leader>d` + `d` = delete line).

### Double-Tap and Quick Action

- **Double-tap** (`dd`, `yy`, `cc`): When the second key matches `action_key`, the line action runs (e.g., `delete_line`)
- **Repeat motion key** (`dww`, `yww`): When the third key matches the motion key, the target under cursor is selected

### Creating Custom Composable Operators

```lua
-- A custom "highlight" operator that composes with all motions
require("smart-motion").register_motion("gh", {
  infer = true,
  collector = "lines",
  filter = "filter_visible",
  visualizer = "hint_start",
  map = true,
  modes = { "n" },
})

-- Register a custom action with key "h" so the infer system finds it
require("smart-motion.core.registries"):get().actions.register("highlight_jump", {
  keys = { "h" },
  run = function(ctx, cfg, motion_state)
    -- jump then highlight
    require("smart-motion.actions.jump").run(ctx, cfg, motion_state)
    -- your custom highlight logic here
  end,
})
```

Now `ghw`, `ghj`, `ghs` etc. all work automatically.

---

## Tips

1. **Start simple.** Get a basic motion working, then add complexity.

2. **Use existing modules.** Browse the built-in collectors, extractors, etc. before writing custom ones.

3. **Test in operator-pending.** Add `"o"` to modes if you want your motion to work with native operators.

4. **Check multi-window.** Set `multi_window = true` if your motion makes sense across splits.

5. **Debug with logging.** Enable `vim.g.smart_motion_log_level = "debug"` to see what's happening.
